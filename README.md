# 💥 CodeChaos

**Welcome to the wild west of software experiments.**  
A platform where developers throw spaghetti code at the wall to see what sticks. Upload your code, share your mess, fork someone else's glorious disaster — and maybe build something legendary in the process.

---

## 🚀 What is CodeChaos?

**CodeChaos** is a no-judgment zone for uploading and sharing random software projects, from MVPs to WTFs.  
It’s not just a code repo — it’s an unfiltered, community-fueled innovation space where code isn’t just written — it *lives, breathes, and breaks sometimes*.

Whether you’re building the next big SaaS or just testing a new API wrapper that auto-generates dad jokes — drop it here.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **🔼 Instant Uploads**: Drag-and-drop your project folders or upload individual files. Fast and flexible.
- **🌍 Public or Private**: Share with the world or keep it low-key. You control your code's visibility.
- **🌀 Random Project Feed**: Click “Feeling Lucky” and explore wild creations from devs across the globe.
- **🧪 Sandbox Testing** *(coming soon)*: Run and test scripts right in the browser (with isolated containers).
- **🧬 Version History**: We track every change, so you can fork, revert, and branch like a boss.
- **💬 Real Talk Reviews**: Comments and feedback from actual developers — brutal honesty encouraged.
- **🎨 Tag-Based Discovery**: Search by tech stack, language, vibes, or sheer randomness.
- **📁 Multi-language Support**: Python, JS, C++, Bash, Rust, Go, Java, Dart, you name it.

## 🧠 Why CodeChaos?

Because sometimes GitHub feels too serious.  
Because StackOverflow won’t let you post your “half-working AI pizza classifier.”  
Because the world needs a place for chaos-driven creativity.  

**CodeChaos isn't about perfection. It's about *momentum*.**
